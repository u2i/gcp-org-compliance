# GCP Organization Compliance Infrastructure

Zero-standing-privilege architecture for implementing compliance in existing Google Cloud Organizations with gradual project migration.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This implementation follows a **zero-standing-privilege model** where:
- Service accounts have read-only baseline permissions
- Write operations require just-in-time privilege elevation (PAM)
- All infrastructure changes go through GitOps workflows
- Projects migrate gradually through compliance tiers

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Infrastructure Deployed
- **Bootstrap Project**: `u2i-bootstrap` with Terraform state management
- **Remote State**: `gs://u2i-tfstate` bucket configured and working
- **Folder Structure**: Three-tier compliance folders created
  - `legacy-systems` (933345237861) - For existing projects with policy exceptions
  - `migration-in-progress` (1003490002560) - Projects being remediated
  - `compliant-systems` (914995929705) - Fully compliant projects
- **Security Policies**: Organization-wide compliance rules with legacy exceptions
- **Assessment Tools**: Project migration and compliance scoring scripts

### 🎯 Ready for Project Migration

The infrastructure is deployed and ready. Next steps:

```bash
# 1. Move remaining projects to legacy folder (130+ projects identified)
./scripts/move-projects-to-legacy.sh 933345237861

# 2. Assess project compliance (10-point scoring system)
./scripts/assess-project-compliance.sh PROJECT_ID

# 3. Begin migration based on compliance scores
# 80%+ compliant → move to compliant-systems folder
# 60-79% compliant → move to migration-in-progress folder  
# <60% compliant → remain in legacy folder for remediation
```

## 📊 Compliance Tiers

### 🟡 Legacy Systems (Temporary Exceptions)
- **Purpose**: Existing projects during migration
- **Policies**: Exceptions for breaking changes
- **Timeline**: Gradual migration over 3-4 months

### 🟠 Migration In Progress (Partial Enforcement)
- **Purpose**: Projects being remediated
- **Policies**: Partial compliance requirements
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks per project batch

### 🟢 Compliant Systems (Full Enforcement)
- **Purpose**: Fully compliant projects
- **Policies**: Complete security policy enforcement
- **Timeline**: Ongoing operational state

## 🛠️ Tools and Scripts

### Project Migration
```bash
# Move all org-level projects to legacy folder
./scripts/move-projects-to-legacy.sh 933345237861

# Move specific project to migration folder
gcloud beta projects move PROJECT_ID --folder=MIGRATION_FOLDER_ID --quiet
```

### Compliance Assessment
```bash
# Assess single project (10-point scoring system)
./scripts/assess-project-compliance.sh my-project-id

# Bulk assessment
gcloud projects list --format="value(projectId)" --filter="parent.type=folder" | \
while read project; do ./scripts/assess-project-compliance.sh $project; done
```

### Assessment Scoring
- **80-100%**: Ready for compliant-systems folder
- **60-79%**: Ready for migration-in-progress folder  
- **0-59%**: Remains in legacy folder, needs remediation plan

## 🔒 Security Features

### Zero-Standing-Privilege Model
- **Bootstrap SA**: Read-only + state bucket access only
- **Organization SA**: Read-only + temporary PAM elevation
- **Manual Override**: Emergency access via break-glass procedures

### Policy Framework
- **Immediate Enforcement**: Critical security policies (audit logging, SSL)
- **Gradual Enforcement**: Breaking policies with legacy exceptions
- **Future Enforcement**: Advanced policies (Binary Authorization, etc.)

### Compliance Monitoring
- Real-time Security Command Center integration
- Automated IAM recommendation tracking
- Continuous policy violation detection

## 🔄 GitOps Workflow

### Pull Request Process
1. **Plan**: Terraform plan on PR creation (read-only)
2. **Review**: Required approvals from security team
3. **Apply**: PAM elevation + terraform apply on merge
4. **Audit**: All changes logged and monitored

### PAM Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
- name: Request PAM Elevation
  run: |
    gcloud beta pam grants create \
      --entitlement="terraform-org-deploy" \
      --requested-duration="1800s" \
      --justification="GitHub Actions deployment"
```

## 📈 Migration Progress Tracking

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Infrastructure Deployed | ✅ Complete | ✅ 100% |
| Projects in Legacy | 5 moved, 125+ remaining | 130+ (100%) |
| Compliance Assessment | Ready | 100% assessed |
| Policy Compliance | Variable | 100% |
| Zero-Standing-Privilege | ✅ Implemented | ✅ 100% |

### Rollback Procedures
- Move projects back to legacy folder if issues arise
- Temporary policy exception adjustments
- Emergency break-glass access procedures

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Break-Glass Access
```bash
# Emergency organization access (use sparingly)
gcloud auth login gcp-failsafe@u2i.com

# Emergency project access
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="user:gcp-failsafe@u2i.com" \
  --role="roles/owner"
```

### Issue Resolution
1. **Service Disruption**: Move project back to legacy folder
2. **Policy Conflicts**: Adjust exceptions in security baseline module
3. **Access Issues**: Use break-glass procedures with full audit trail

## 🤝 Contributing

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch
2. Test changes in development environment
3. Submit PR with compliance impact assessment
4. Security team review and approval
5. Automated deployment via GitOps

### Module Updates
- Uses pre-built modules from `terraform-google-compliance-modules`
- Version pinned to `v1.0.19` for stability
- Update process requires security review
